remark: The Mammalian Phenotype Ontology is being developed by Cynthia L. Smith, Susan M. Bello, Carroll W. Goldsmith and Janan T. Eppig, as part of the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) Project, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. Copyright 2007 The Jackson Laboratory. This file contains pre-coordinated phenotype terms, definitions and synonyms that can be used to describe mammalian phenotypes. The ontology is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It organizes phenotype terms into major biological system headers such as nervous system and respiratory system.  Behavior and lethality terms are also represented. This ontology is currently under development. Daily updates are available at the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) ftp site (ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/index.html#pheno) as well as the OBO Foundry site (http://obofoundry.org/). Questions, comments and suggestions are welcome, and should be directed to pheno@informatics.jax.org MGD is funded by NIH/NHGRI grant HG000330.

comment: The synonym abnormal hippocampal formation is a frequently used synonym in the literature for the hippocampus. It is unfortunate that it implies a developmental process. There is also a lack of consensus relating to terms describing the hippocampus and/or the adjacent cerebral cortex with the term hippocampus sometimes referring to the hippocampal formation (or region) and sometimes only to the Ammon gyrus (Ammon's horn). In this ontology, we have used hippocampus to mean the entire formation (region).

comment: In rodents, the prostate gland consists of three lobes, the anterior prostate (AP; also known as the coagulating gland), the dorsolateral prostate (DLP), and the ventral prostate (VP). These lobes are arranged circumferentially around the urethra and display characteristic patterns of ductal branching and protein secretion (PMID:3308446). In contrast, the adult human prostate lacks discernible lobular organization and, instead, completely envelops the urethra at the base of the bladder (PMID:3308446).

However, this is not technically correct and we have modified this ontology to define the prenatal period to include the embryonic stages distinctly from the fetal stages. The names embryonic lethality and embryonic death have been retained as a narrow synonyms to aid in searching for those species that may use these terms as synonyms.

comment: Note that significant differences exist among populations of melanocytes that populate the cutaneous tissue compared to melanocytes that populate ocular, auditory, and internal body sites. Extracutaneous melanotcytes synthesize melanosomes and melanin only during a short interval after arriving in their target tissue, and they retain their melanosomes throughout the life of the organism instead of transferring to neighboring cells like dermal melanocytes. General morphology and ultrastructure of extracutaneous melanocytes vary and also differ from cutaneous melanocytes.

The PR interval reflects the time the electrical impulse takes to travel from the sinus node through the AV node and entering the ventricles. The PR interval is therefore a good estimate of AV node function.

def: "increased variation of beat-to-beat intervals of the heart that occurs in conjunction with the respiratory cycle" [RGD:cur]
comment: Heart rate variability (HRV) is the variation of beat-to-beat intervals. A healthy heart has a large HRV, while decreased or absent variability may indicate cardiac disease. HRV also decreases with exercise-induced tachycardia. Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to the beat-to-beat alterations in heart rate. Under resting conditions, the ECG of healthy individuals exhibits periodic variation in R-R intervals. This rhythmic phenomenon, known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), fluctuates with the phase of respiration -- cardio-acceleration during inspiration, and cardio-deceleration during expiration. RSA is predominantly mediated by respiratory gating of parasympathetic efferent activity to the heart: vagal efferent traffic to the sinus node occurs primarily in phase with expiration and is absent or attenuated during inspiration. The major reason for the interest in measuring HRV stems from its ability to predict survival after heart attack. Over half a dozen prospective studies have shown that reduced HRV predicts sudden death in patients with MI, independent of other prognostic indicators such as ejection fraction. Reduced HRV appears to be a marker of fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Moreover, a small number of studies have begun to suggest that reduced HRV may predict risk of survival even among individuals free of CHD.

comment: Follicular dendritic cells are a distinct population from other dendritic cells associated with T cells. Follicular dendritic cells have Fc receptors and C3b receptors, but unlike other dendritic cells, they do not process or present antigen in a way that allows recognition by T cells. Instead, they hold antigen in the form of immune complexes on their surfaces for long periods and can present antigen to B cells during an immune response. They are not derived from the hematopoietic lineage. Due to its unique lineage and distinct function (B cell vs. T cell presentation), this is NOT a type of dendritic cell.

However, this is not technically correct and we have modified this ontology to define the prenatal period to include the embryonic stages distinctly from the fetal stages. The names embryonic lethality and embryonic death have been retained as a narrow synonyms for the prenatal lethality term to aid in searching for those species that may use these terms as synonyms.

Extracutaneous melanotcytes synthesize melanosomes and melanin only during a short interval after arriving in their target tissue, and they retain their melanosomes throughout the life of the organism instead of transferring to neighboring cells like dermal melanocytes. General morphology and ultrastructure of extracutaneous melanocytes vary and also differ from cutaneous melanocytes.

comment: The definition of the previous ID MP:0006008 [abnormal neurogenesis] specified only the growth or development of neurons; this is not the accepted definition of neurogenesis in GO:0022008 or most dictionary resources; these include all cells of the nervous system including glia. A new term of abnormal neuron differentiation was created that matched the definition and MP:0006008 [abnormal neurogenesis] has been merged into it.

comment: Note that there is no consensus in the literature about whether the perifollicular zone (which does not exist in rodents) is part of the splenic red or white pulp. Notable differences in the structure of the spleen exist between humans and rodents. In this ontology, the marginal sinus (which doen not exist in human) has been included as part of the white pulp and may be the rodent functional equivalent of the human perifollicular zone.

name: abnormal kidney collecting duct principal cell morphology
def: "any structural abnormality of the cuboidal epithelial cells found in the collecting ducts of the kidney which regulate sodium and potassium balance via channels located on the cells apical membrane. Aldosterone increases the number of Na+/K+-ATPase pumps that allow increased sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion whereas antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) determines the expression of aquaporin channels on the cell surface; together, aldosterone and vasopressin let the principal cell control the quantity of water that is reabsorbed" [MGI:anna]
