remark: The Mammalian Phenotype Ontology is being developed by Cynthia L. Smith, Susan M. Bello, Carroll W. Goldsmith and Janan T. Eppig, as part of the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) Project, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. Copyright 2007 The Jackson Laboratory. This file contains pre-coordinated phenotype terms, definitions and synonyms that can be used to describe mammalian phenotypes. The ontology is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It organizes phenotype terms into major biological system headers such as nervous system and respiratory system.  Behavior and lethality terms are also represented. This ontology is currently under development. Daily updates are available at the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) ftp site (ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/index.html#pheno) as well as the OBO Foundry site (http://obofoundry.org/). Questions, comments and suggestions are welcome, and should be directed to pheno@informatics.jax.org MGD is funded by NIH/NHGRI grant HG000330.
