Yes, sorry about this, I didn't check it before.
You can use the GWT with PHP directly, there is a tutorial here:
https://sites.google.com/site/angelhurtado/tutorialgwt2

If you like, you can also use something else, such as the Yahoo User
Interface Library (http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/), which has
better PHP support than GWT (see
http://yuilibrary.com/projects/phploader/). The important feature that
you would want is that a Javascript application can run in a browser and
communicate with a server using XML, i.e., that you use AJAX
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)).

I hope this helps,
Rob.
