Get weaknesses and strengths of Phenomenet.
If it isn't passed a Phenotype ID in the variable via GET, it uses the Root ID of the whole tree (MP:0000001), to get all of the top level parts of the tree. It then opens the file mammalian_phenotype.obo which contains the full list of Mammalian Phenotypes discovered, formatted in a consistent manner. The script then prints some HTML to the page, and uses the variable to assign an ID in the <div> tag which is essential for the J-Query on tree.html to work. The script searches through the file and finds all entries which have a parent ID which matches the original Phenotype ID given to the script. The script has to use the PHP function  'preg_match' to find what it is looking for, and then uses explode to split the term up. Two more functions, str_replace and trim()  are used on the string before it is ready to be compared with the original variable. The script then prints out all results that match with HTML mark up, and this is what the J-Query uses to produce the tree.
