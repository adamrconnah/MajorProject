/**
 * Wrap a librdf_stream as a PHP iterator using SPL.
 *
 * Despite the name, the class in this file wraps librdf_stream, not
 * librdf_iterator.  Since the node iteration functions in {@link LibRDF_Model} 
 * were not implemented in favor of only {@link LibRDF_Model#findStatements}, 
 * the only need for an iterable object was one using the stream of 
 * librdf_statements.
 *
 * PHP version 5

 * Wrap a librdf_stream resource as an iterable object.
 *
 * This class should not be created directly, nor are its methods of interest
 * to the casual user.  Its only intent is to provide a return type for
 * LibRDF_Model::find_statements, as well as the underlying iterator for both
 * LibRDF_Model and LibRDF_GraphQueryResults, that can then be used in a PHP
 * foreach statement without any direct function calls.
 *
 * Objects of this type may only be used for iteration once.  Once iteration
 * has begun, a call to rewind will render the object invalid.
